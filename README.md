### Clone repo
<code>git clone https://github.com/mageem2/poseTracking.git</code>

  
### Navigate to the 'poseTracking' project then run:
<code>npm install</code>

### Run app
<code>expo start</code>

- If there is an issue with running expo, namely something to do with the digital signature being unreadable, run:

  - <code>Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted</code>

- Select either 'Yes' or 'Yes to All', and re-run the app.

### After the App is running

- A web page will pop up. From there, select the tunnel option. If this is your first time running the app, 'ngrok' will download. The tunnel option will need to be selected for the app to run.
